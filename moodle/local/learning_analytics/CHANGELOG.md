## [0.9.0] - 2020-09-28
### Added
- Administration: Option `course_customfield` added to status option
  - If the Moodle version is >= 3.7, administration can set the setting `status` to `course_customfield` to let teachers decide 
    whether the `Learning Analytics` link should be shown in the navigation. If the option is selected, the plugin will add a customfield
    to the course settings, so that teachers can enable/disable the setting on their own.
- Activities report: Visible dividers added between course sections
### Fixed
- Activities report: Default section name not showing

## [0.8.0] - 2020-05-29
Thanks a lot to Jonathan Liebers who implemented the Postgres support and improved multiple SQL queries.

- If a person is enrolled multiple times into a course, they are counted only once now.
### Removed
- Removed notice in the UI introduced in version `v0.7.3`

## [0.7.4] - 2020-05-15
### Fixed
- Notice regarding reset of browser/OS report is also shown in test environment and when there is no data to show

## [0.7.3] - 2020-05-13
Note: This version was released and tagged as `v0.7.3` but accidentally marked as `v0.8.0` in the `version.php`.
### Fixed

- Added missing language keys for learners page

## [0.7.0] - 2020-04-24
### Added
- Option `student_rolenames` added. In case the system uses special names for users (instead of the default role name `student`), this setting can be used to configure the option. So far, the learners report was not able to show data in RWTHmoodle due to this.

### Fixed
- Students are now able to filter by module type in activities report again

### Changed
- Changed how activities report works. It now uses the `get_fast_modinfo` function of Moodle to list courses. This allows a better order and uses the Moodle cache.
### Removed
- Option `allow_dashboard_compare` is removed for now as it is currently in an unstable state.

## [0.5.0] - 2020-04-03
### Added
- Settings added: `status` and `course_ids`
  - `status` defines in which courses the Learning Analytics UI is linked/shown
